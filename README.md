# GPA Calculator

## Introduction
This is a simple program that allows you to calculate your GPA with persistent storage feature for future referencing.

Note that this is targeted towards Nanyang Polytechnic students so feel free to change the gpaRef hashmap variable accordingly on [line 23](https://github.com/KJHJason/GPACalculator/blob/master/src/GPA.cpp#L23-L34).

Furthermore, I'm still in the midst of learning C++ so if there are bugs, please let me know.

## Features
- Calculate your GPA
- Edit your results and save the changes
- Delete a module from the json file
- Read all modules from the json file

## Dependencies
- [jsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)
